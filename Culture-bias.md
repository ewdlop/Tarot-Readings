straight calling someone crazy isn't scientific

also calling something crazy just meant to be saying something is above the norm

sociology already knew the Japanese/English right steering wheel is statically abnormal but we don't call them crazy.

are you calling being scientific crazy too?

or you are calling science crazy...

and all it is saying is: "crazy" is scientific

NO I am not saying you are saying anything.
